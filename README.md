# Spring Boot Access Camp API

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Spring Boot Campers API project. As part of my bootcamp at FactoriaF5, I had the fantastic opportunity to work on this assignment. This README will give you an overview of what I've accomplished and the technologies I've used.

## Overview

I'm thrilled to share my progress on this project! Campers Api, my imaginary client, wanted a website to manage campers and their activities. While working on this assignment, I delved into Java Spring Boot, a technology I'm relatively new to. I also explored Model Mapper and learned to debug my Java code effectively.

## Learning Goals

Throughout this project, I aimed to achieve the following learning goals:

- **Create a Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr**: I started from scratch using Spring Initializr to set up my project.

- **Build an API according to the deliverables**: I designed and implemented an API based on the requirements outlined in the project guidelines.

- **Unit test a Spring application**: Testing played a vital role in ensuring the reliability of my code.

## Technologies Used

Here are the technologies and tools I used during this project:

- [Java Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): This powerful framework allowed me to build a robust and scalable application.

- [Model Mapper](http://modelmapper.org/): Model Mapper proved to be a helpful library for object mapping and conversion.

- Debugger: Debugging tools were my trusty companions, helping me identify and fix issues in my code.

## Getting Started

To dive into this project yourself, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

## Building and Running

Here's how you can build and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Configure the application properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
4. Build the project.
5. Run the Spring Boot application.

## API Documentation

I've documented the API thoroughly to make it easier for anyone to understand and use. You can access the detailed documentation [here](#api-documentation-link). Make sure to update this link when you generate the documentation for your project.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing played a significant role in ensuring the reliability of my code. I encourage you to follow best practices in testing your application. You can refer to the [Spring Boot Testing Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.testing) for guidance.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to FactoriaF5 for providing me with this fantastic learning opportunity. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to me at [your email address].

Happy coding! ðŸš€
